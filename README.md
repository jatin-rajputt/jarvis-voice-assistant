Jarvis Voice Assistant

Author: Jatin
Project Type: Major Project

Jarvis is a secure, voice-controlled desktop assistant built with Python.
It can automate system tasks, manage files, fetch news, control audio, and respond intelligently using AI when available.

✨ Features

Voice activation (Jarvis)

Open websites (Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn)

System controls (shutdown, restart, sleep) with PIN protection

File & folder management (create, delete, list)

News fetching (MediaStack API)

CPU, RAM, battery status

Volume control (up, down, mute)

Jokes & time/date

AI-powered responses (optional)

Automatic Google Search fallback (no API required)

🔑 API Key Setup (Optional)

Jarvis supports AI responses using the OpenAI API.
If you do not set an API key, Jarvis will automatically fall back to Google Search.

✅ Option 1: Using OpenAI API (Recommended)

Create a file named .env in the project root.

Add your API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_api_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_mediastack_api_key


Save the file.

Ensure .env is included in .gitignore.

Jarvis will now answer unknown voice commands intelligently.

✅ Option 2: No API Key (Search Fallback Mode)

If you do not have an OpenAI API key:

Jarvis will not crash

Jarvis will open Google Search automatically

Fully functional without AI

Example:

User: Jarvis
User: what is artificial intelligence
Jarvis: I will search this on Google

🔄 How Command Handling Works

Jarvis listens for known commands

If command is recognized → action is executed

If command is unknown:

OpenAI API available → AI response

No API key → Google Search fallback

▶️ How to Run the Project
Step 1: Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv

Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run Jarvis
python src/main.py
